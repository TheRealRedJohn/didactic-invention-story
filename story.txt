There was a boy called Ben who really enjoyed playing sports. He favourite of all the sports is Tennis. His coach always used to say that he was very a talented player.

Ben had an upcoming championship game that he was practicing a lot for.  He was known for being very quick on the field.  One day, while running some laps, he fell and injured his leg.  He didn't care so much about the health of his body more so than he cared about possibly having to miss the upcoming championship.  What was he going to do?
