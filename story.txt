There was a boy called Ben who really enjoyed playing sports. He favourite of all the sports is Tennis. His coach always used to say that he was very a talented player.

Ben had an upcoming championship game that he was practicing a lot for.  He was known for being very quick on the field.  One day, while running some laps, he fell and injured his leg.  He didn't care so much about the health of his body more so than he cared about possibly having to miss the upcoming championship.  What was he going to do?

Ben decided to confide with his coach and asked for his opinion. The coach said the decicsion is yours. So ben had a choice. Does he play and risk injury for a chance to play in a championship game? Or does he preserve his health? Ben chose to play.
